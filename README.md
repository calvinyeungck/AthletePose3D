## 📂 Dataset Features  
- 🏅 **12 sports motions** across various disciplines  
- 🎞️ **1.3M frames** & **165K postures**  
- ⚡ Focus on **high-intensity athletic movements**  

## 📊 Model Evaluation  
- 📉 **SOTA models trained on conventional datasets struggle with athletic motions**  
- 🎯 Fine-tuning on **AthletePose3D** reduces **MPJPE from 214mm → 65mm** (**69% improvement!**)  

## 🔬 Kinematic Validation  
- ✅ Strong **joint angle correlation**  
- ⚠️ **Limitations in velocity estimation**  

## 🚀 Contribution  
- Benchmarking **monocular pose estimation for sports**  
- Advancing **pose estimation in high-performance environments**
